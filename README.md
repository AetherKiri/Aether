## Overview

AetherKiri is a multi-runtime visual-novel platform inside a Godot 4.7
application shell. A single `AetherRuntimePlayer` hosts multiple native
runtimes behind a versioned provider interface, while Godot owns the product
UI, final-frame presentation, input, settings, export presets, and platform
packaging. The runtime dispatcher selects KiriRuntime, OnsRuntime, optional
A Runtime, or C Runtime (CatSystem2) from each game's markers and capabilities.

The default product renderer is **Godot Native**: engine frames are rendered
through Godot-owned `RenderingDevice` resources. **GPU Bridge** remains an
explicit compatibility and performance comparison backend for external native
GPU render targets imported by Godot. **Debug CPU** is available as a visible
diagnostic fallback only.

```text
Godot App Shell
  -> AetherRuntimePlayer
    -> Runtime Dispatcher
      -> KiriRuntime -> KiriKiri2 Core / Plugins
      -> OnsRuntime -> OnscripterYuri
      -> A Runtime
      -> C Runtime -> CatSystem2
```

In distributed builds, OnsRuntime, A Runtime, and C Runtime are beta features
that require an active 30-day coffee entitlement. Debug builds keep these
runtimes unrestricted for compatibility development and testing.

## Highlights

- Godot 4.7 app shell with native GDExtension integration.
- One stable `AetherRuntimePlayer` and a versioned provider ABI for current and
  future runtimes.
- C++17 KiriKiri2 runtime core with visual, audio, storage, VM, and plugin
  support.
- OnscripterYuri integration whose composed RGBA frames are displayed by a
  Godot `ImageTexture`, with Godot pointer, touch, and keyboard input mapped
  back to ONS events.
- Export paths for macOS, iOS/iPadOS, Android, and Web.
- Runtime-selectable render backend with persisted settings.
- Bundled multilingual KAG3 demo that can be played from the library and
  deleted by the player.
- Probe scripts for smoke, render, interaction, performance, and manual repro
  sessions.
- Manual compatibility notes for tested titles in
  [`doc/verified_games.md`](doc/verified_games.md).
- GPL-3.0-or-later source distribution.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/godot_app/` | Godot project, scenes, settings UI, performance/log panel, icons, and export presets. |
| `bridge/godot_extension/` | Godot native host library entry points. |
| `bridge/engine_api/` | C ABI used by the host layer to drive the C++ engine. |
| `bridge/onscripter_runtime/` | Headless OnscripterYuri host, frame capture, and input bridge. |
| `bridge/siglus_runtime/` | Siglus runtime provider plus build-time overlay (patches + FFI files) applied to the pristine `siglus_rs` sources; see `bridge/siglus_runtime/overlay/`. |
| `cpp/core/` | KiriKiri2 runtime, visual system, audio, storage, VM, and plugin support. |
| `cpp/plugins/` | Bundled native plugin implementations and compatibility stubs. |
| `packages/AetherInternal/` | Optional private E-mote package submodule; public builds work without it. |
| `packages/OnscripterYuri/` | Public OnscripterYuri git submodule. |

## Built-in Demo

The product package includes the multilingual AetherKiri KAG3 demo at
`apps/godot_app/builtin_demos/aetherkiri-kag3/data.xp3`. On first launch the
app atomically stages a writable copy under `user://builtin_games/` and adds it
to the normal game library, so it uses the same launch and play-time flow as an
imported game.

Deleting this library entry removes the staged archive and its local saves,
including the browser's separate persistent save directory, and records the
player's choice. Refreshing or upgrading the app does not restore the demo;
instead, it retries any unfinished cleanup. The signed seed remains part of
the application package, so deleting the writable copy cannot shrink the
installed app bundle.
The editable source and rebuild instructions are in
[`demos/aetherkiri-kag3/`](demos/aetherkiri-kag3/).

## Render Backends

| Backend | Role | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Godot Native | Godot-owned GPU rendering path. | Default product path |
| GPU Bridge | External GPU render-target bridge for comparison and compatibility. | Optional backend |
| Debug CPU | RGBA readback/upload fallback. | Debugging only |

The Godot settings UI persists the selected backend and warns when changing it
while a game session is active, because render resources must be recreated.

## Icon and Assets

The app icon shown above is the same icon configured by the Godot project:

- App icon: `apps/godot_app/assets/icon.png`
- SVG source used by the Godot project: `apps/godot_app/assets/icon.svg`
- Export icon set: `apps/godot_app/assets/icons/`
iOS and Android export presets reference the generated PNG sizes under
`apps/godot_app/assets/icons/`, including App Store and launcher sizes.

## Runtime Platform Requirements

| Platform | Minimum version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | macOS 13.0 (Ventura) | Internal E-mote builds use the bundled official SDK's native `arm64` driver. |
| iOS / iPadOS | iOS / iPadOS 16.0 | `arm64` devices; `arm64` and `x86_64` simulator builds are available for development. |
| Android | Android 8.0 (API 26) | The product export currently packages `arm64-v8a` only. |
| Web | No OS version floor | Requires a browser with WebAssembly SIMD, WebAssembly threads, and `SharedArrayBuffer`, served with cross-origin isolation (COOP/COEP). |
| Linux | Build from source | No official prebuilt product package; compile the `x86_64` export locally. |
| Windows | Build from source | No official prebuilt product package; compile the native targets locally. |

## Requirements

- CMake 3.28+
- Ninja
- NASM (required by the native FFmpeg dependency)
- Rust toolchain (rustup) with the `aarch64-linux-android` target installed
  (`rustup target add aarch64-linux-android`) for the bundled Siglus runtime;
  iOS/Web Siglus builds additionally need their respective targets. Builds
  degrade gracefully to “Siglus disabled” when no Rust toolchain is found.
- vcpkg in `.devtools/vcpkg` or available through `VCPKG_ROOT`
- Godot at `/Applications/Godot.app` or `GODOT_BIN=/path/to/Godot`
- Xcode for macOS/iOS exports
- Android SDK/NDK for Android exports. The script uses
  `ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` when set, otherwise
  `$HOME/Library/Android/sdk`, and prefers an installed NDK 28.x release.
  Set `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` (or `ANDROID_NDK_VERSION`) to select a specific NDK;
  Android builds for the Godot 4.7 export template should use NDK 28.1.13356709.
- Emscripten/emsdk for Web exports, with `emcc`, `em++`, and `emar` on `PATH`.
- Godot Web GDExtension/dlink export templates installed as
  `web_dlink_debug.zip` and `web_dlink_release.zip`.
- Node.js and npm for the TypeScript/Vite local Web server.
- The official E-mote SDK for internal Artemis and CatSystem2 E-mote builds.
  Install it before configuring or testing an internal build with
  `packages/AetherInternal/tools/install_emote_sdk.sh`.

### Linux

The Linux development environment is project-local. It keeps Godot, vcpkg,
vcpkg downloads/binaries, assembler tools, npm, and Godot XDG data in
`.aetherkiri-cache/` (override with `AETHERKIRI_CACHE_DIR`). Bootstrap it with:

```bash
./tools/setup_linux.sh
```

On Arch Linux, the bootstrap uses the system packages when available and can
place the tool-only `zip`, `nasm`, and `yasm` packages under the project cache
when it cannot elevate. Install the broader system prerequisites
once for the normal host-managed setup:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake ninja pkgconf git curl unzip ccache nasm yasm
```

Delete `.aetherkiri-cache/` to reclaim all reusable local build caches and
tool downloads. The Linux build links `apps/godot_app/.godot` to this cache
root and recreates its cache target on the next build. Build outputs remain
under `out/`; remove a Linux configuration with
`./build.sh --clean linux debug` or `./build.sh --clean linux release`.

## Build

Initialize the public ONS runtime after cloning:

```bash
git submodule update --init packages/OnscripterYuri
```

Plugin compatibility work that needs compiled TJS2 analysis can additionally
initialize the optional developer helper:

```bash
git submodule update --init packages/tjs2Decompiler
```

See [`doc/development.md`](doc/development.md#compiled-tjs2-analysis) for its
build and evidence-validation workflow.

The public repository builds and runs CI without access to private packages.
Maintainers with access to the complete E-mote and native Live2D
implementations can initialize the optional package before building:

```bash
git submodule update --init packages/AetherInternal
packages/AetherInternal/tools/install_emote_sdk.sh
```

CMake enables it automatically when present. The installer verifies the SDK
and writes generated headers and libraries under the private package; the
tracked macOS ARM archive remains part of that package. On macOS, the normal
internal command builds the native `arm64` configuration and uses the
bundled SDK archive. Use
`-DAETHERKIRI_ENABLE_INTERNAL=OFF` to test the public fallback, or
`-DAETHERKIRI_INTERNAL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/AetherInternal` to use a separate
checkout. Trusted runs of the `Build` GitHub Actions workflow use the
`AETHERSECRET` repository secret as a read-only SSH key and initialize the
private submodule recursively. Fork and Dependabot pull requests cannot access
repository secrets, so those untrusted runs use the public fallback.

The internal package extends the existing public `motionplayer`, runtime, and
`krkr2plugin` targets; it does not replace those targets or copy their public
source trees. KiriRuntime, Artemis, and CatSystem2 share the official GPU
E-mote SDK bridge; supported mobile targets retain native shared GPU frames,
while macOS uses the SDK's asynchronous transfer path across the OpenGL and
MoltenVK boundary.
For native Live2D, it contributes the Cubism SDK, `.l2d` loader, motion player,
and renderer while the public repository keeps the script-compatible fallback
and generic GPU bridge. Both configurations run the same public tests. A
package/API mismatch stops configuration instead of silently building an
incompatible combination.

Common builds:

```bash
./build.sh macos debug
./build.sh macos release
./build.sh ios debug --simulator
./build.sh ios release
./build.sh android debug --abi=arm64-v8a
./build.sh android release --abi=arm64-v8a
./build.sh web debug
./build.sh web release
./build.sh linux debug
./build.sh linux release
```

The scripts build the native engine and Godot host library, stage them under
`apps/godot_app/bin/`, then run the matching Godot export preset when Godot is
available. Linux exports include the required vcpkg shared libraries beside
the executable, so their engine runtime does not depend on the local build
tree. Android is currently wired for `arm64-v8a`.

## ONScripter Games

OnscripterYuri is included as a public Git submodule. The public request and
commitments concerning integration permission and licensing are recorded in
[upstream issue #75](https://github.com/YuriSizuku/OnscripterYuri/issues/75).
The applicable rights remain governed by OnscripterYuri's GPL notices and the
copyright notices preserved in its source tree.

Add the game directory to the library as usual. AetherKiri selects
OnscripterYuri when it finds `0.txt`, `00.txt`, `nscript.dat`,
`nscr_sec.dat`, `nscript.___`, `onscript.nt2`, or `onscript.nt3`. The engine
composes at the script's native resolution; AetherKiri uploads the final RGBA
frame to a Godot texture and presents it through the existing aspect-preserving
`TextureRect`, without a second native window.

ONS saves are stored in the game's `savedata/` directory so they stay with the
game across app updates or reinstalls whenever the game directory is retained.
Existing saves from the former app-owned
`onscripter_saves/<game-name-path-hash>/` location are copied on first launch
without overwriting files already in `savedata/`. Read-only game folders fall
back to the app-owned location. The default script encoding matches upstream
and is GBK; set `AETHERKIRI_ONS_ENCODING=gbk|sjis|utf8` to override it. Like
the existing KiriKiri runtime, one app process owns one visual-novel session;
restart Aether after a game exits.

The repository includes a minimal ONS render fixture:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="$PWD/tests/fixtures/onscripter_smoke" \
  /Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --headless --path apps/godot_app \
  --script res://scripts/smoke_test.gd
```

The ONS `mpegplay`, `avi`, and `movie` commands share AetherKiri's FFmpeg
media pipeline. `movie click`, `loop`, `pos`, `async`, and `movie stop` are
implemented; decoded video frames are composited at script coordinates and
audio is played by the media pipeline. Movies stored in NSA/NS2/SAR archives
are extracted on demand to the user cache.

To exercise the complete movie-command bridge, place a test video at
`tests/fixtures/onscripter_movie_smoke/video.avi`, then run:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="$PWD/tests/fixtures/onscripter_movie_smoke" \
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_EXPECT_SCRIPT_MEDIA=1 \
  /Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --headless --path apps/godot_app \
  --script res://scripts/smoke_test.gd
```

## Tagged Releases

Pushing a SemVer tag such as `0.3.0` or `0.3.0-beta.1` starts the
`Release` workflow. The tag, without an optional leading `v`, becomes the
version shown inside Aether and the Android `versionName`. The numeric SemVer
core becomes the iOS and macOS marketing version, while the GitHub run number
and attempt produce a monotonically increasing Apple build number and Android
`versionCode`.

The Apple jobs use the GitHub-hosted `macos-latest` image. Tagged iOS builds
fail early unless the selected Xcode contains the iOS 26 SDK or newer. Regular CI
continues to produce an unsigned IPA for validation. Tagged releases require
App Store signing for both Apple platforms. Set `AETHERID` to the registered
Bundle ID `com.liuyu.aether.aether` and configure these repository Actions
secrets:

- `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`: base64-encoded Apple Distribution
  `.p12` certificate and private key.
- `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: password for that `.p12`.
- `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`: base64-encoded App Store provisioning
  profile for `com.liuyu.aether.aether` and team `3JL7FE9XQT`.
- `MACOS_INSTALLER_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`: base64-encoded Mac Installer
  Distribution `.p12` certificate and private key.
- `MACOS_INSTALLER_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: password for the Mac installer
  `.p12`.
- `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`: base64-encoded Mac App Store
  provisioning profile for `com.liuyu.aether.aether` and team `3JL7FE9XQT`.
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID`: App Store Connect API key ID.
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID`: App Store Connect issuer ID.
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`: base64-encoded App Store
  Connect `AuthKey_*.p8` file.

The macOS App Store package is Apple Silicon-only, enables App Sandbox, and
allows read-write access to files selected by the user. The Release workflow
validates and uploads the signed iOS IPA and macOS installer package to App
Store Connect before publishing the GitHub Release. Apple processes accepted
uploads asynchronously; selecting the processed builds and submitting them to
App Review remains a separate App Store Connect operation. Missing or partial
signing and API credentials fail the tagged release instead of silently
publishing an unsigned store artifact.

## Run and Test Artifacts

Web builds produce an Emscripten GDExtension side module at
`apps/godot_app/bin/web/<debug|release>/aether_kiri_godot.wasm`, then export
the Godot Web app to `out/godot/web/<debug|release>/index.html` when the dlink
template is installed. The Web export is built for threaded, SIMD-enabled
WebAssembly, so the served app needs cross-origin isolation headers. Cloud
deployments import local games through the browser's file/directory picker and
mount the authorized `File`/`Blob` objects with on-demand Range reads instead
of copying multi-GB game packages into the Emscripten virtual filesystem.

### macOS

Build and launch the exported app:

```bash
./build.sh macos release
open out/godot/macos/release/AetherKiri.app
```

Run the debug build from a terminal to inspect logs:

```bash
./build.sh macos debug
out/godot/macos/debug/AetherKiri.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherKiri
```

Add a game through the app UI, or pass a local test game only for the current
run:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_GAME_PATH="/path/to/game" \
out/godot/macos/debug/AetherKiri.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherKiri
```

### iOS Simulator

Build the simulator export:

```bash
./build.sh ios debug --simulator
```

Open the generated Xcode project, or install the built app with `simctl` after
building it from Xcode:

```bash
xcrun simctl boot "iPad Pro 11-inch (M4)"
xcrun simctl install booted /path/to/AetherKiri.app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.example.aetherkiri
```

The bundle identifier depends on the export preset and signing configuration.

### iOS Device

Build the iOS export project:

```bash
./build.sh ios release
```

Then build and install with Xcode or command line tools:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project out/godot/ios/release/AetherKiri.xcodeproj \
  -scheme AetherKiri \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  build
```

After Xcode creates `AetherKiri.app`, install it to a paired device:

```bash
xcrun devicectl list devices
xcrun devicectl device install app \
  --device <device-identifier> \
  /path/to/AetherKiri.app
```

On iOS/iPadOS, copy games through the Files app into:

```text
On My iPhone/iPad -> AetherKiri -> Games
```

Return to AetherKiri and tap refresh.

### Android

Build the debug APK:

```bash
./build.sh android debug --abi=arm64-v8a
```

The APK is written to:

```text
out/godot/android/debug/Aether-debug.apk
```

Install and launch it on a connected device or emulator:

```bash
adb install -r out/godot/android/debug/Aether-debug.apk
adb shell monkey -p org.github.krkr2.aetherkiri \
  -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
```

Build the release APK:

```bash
./build.sh android release --abi=arm64-v8a
```

The release APK is written to:

```text
out/godot/android/release/Aether-release.apk
```

The release preset is intentionally unsigned until a project release keystore is
configured. Sign it before installing or distributing it:

```bash
apksigner sign --ks /path/to/release.keystore \
  out/godot/android/release/Aether-release.apk
```

On Android, import games through the app UI on platforms with file-system
access. On restricted devices, copy the game directory into the app's
documents/storage location and use refresh.

### Web

Activate Emscripten before building:

```bash
source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
./build.sh web debug
```

The export is written to:

```text
out/godot/web/debug/index.html
```

Run it from an HTTP server, not by opening the file directly:

```bash
npm install
npm run web:dev:debug
```

Vite serves the exported static files with the COOP/COEP headers required by
`SharedArrayBuffer` and Godot's threaded Web export. For a release export, run
`npm run web:dev:release`.

Cloud deployments do not configure server-side game paths. Users click Import
in the browser and authorize a local game directory or XP3 file. Imported game
files are mounted as read-only inputs; saves, game configuration, and other
runtime writes are persisted in the current site's IndexedDB-backed `/userfs`,
not written back to the user's original game directory. For local development
only, Vite can expose a read-only test game root:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_GAME_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/game \
AETHERKIRI_WEB_AUTO_START=1 \
npm run web:dev:release
```

Use `AETHERKIRI_GAME_ROOTS` with the platform path delimiter for multiple roots.
`AETHERKIRI_WEB_AUTO_START_INDEX=1` or `AETHERKIRI_WEB_AUTO_START_NAME=title`
selects a specific configured root. These environment variables are developer
shortcuts, not the product import path.

## Validation

Useful migration checks:

```bash
rg "F[l]utter|f[l]utter|A[N]GLE|Platform[ ]Graphics" README.md README.zh-CN.md apps bridge build CMakeLists.txt
rg "u[n]official-angle|l[i]bEGL|l[i]bGLESv2" CMakeLists.txt bridge cpp build vcpkg.json
./build.sh macos debug
./build.sh ios debug --simulator
./build.sh android debug --abi=arm64-v8a
./build.sh web debug
build/validate_godot_native.sh
build/validate_gpu_bridge.sh
```

Godot script checks:

```bash
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --headless \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --check-only \
  --quit
```

## Per-Game Probe Profiles

Probe scripts can be driven by `AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG`. Keep committed profiles
generic; do not commit local absolute game paths. Use `AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME` or
an untracked local profile for machine-specific paths.

Example smoke test:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG="$PWD/tests/profiles/kr37s.json" \
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="/path/to/game" \
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --script res://scripts/smoke_test.gd
```

Example render/interaction probe:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG="$PWD/tests/profiles/kr37s.json" \
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="/path/to/game" \
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --script res://scripts/step_render_probe.gd
```

Manual render probe for clicking through a repro:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG="$PWD/tests/profiles/kr37s.json" \
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="/path/to/game" \
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --script res://scripts/manual_render_probe.gd
```

The manual probe forwards mouse, wheel, touch, and keyboard input to the game.
Press `F12` to save `/tmp/aetherkiri-manual-*.png`; press `Esc` to exit.

Profile fields:

- `game_path`: optional game directory or XP3 path. Keep blank in committed
  profiles unless the path is portable.
- `backend`: render backend, usually `Godot Native`.
- `surface_size`: engine render surface, for example `[1280, 720]`.
- `window_size`: probe window size.
- `coord_size`: coordinate space used by recorded click points.
- `startup_timeout_frames`, `warmup_frames`, `after_click_frames`,
  `measure_frames`: timing knobs.
- `clicks`: ordered interaction steps with `name`, `x`, `y`, and optional
  `after_frames`.
- `perf_input`: compatibility settings for `perf_input_probe.gd`.

Acceptance requires startup, rendering, input, menu operations, audio, save
paths, clean exit, and performance parity from Godot Native or GPU Bridge. Debug
CPU is only a diagnostic fallback.
